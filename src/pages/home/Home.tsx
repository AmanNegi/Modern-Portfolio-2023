          I'm a passionate computer science student with a flair for mobile
          development. I've been crafting projects using Flutter and Android
          that make me proud. But that's not all â€“ I'm broadening my horizons by
          diving into the realms of ReactJS and NextJS. Besides, I'm an eager
          beaver when it comes to contributing to open-source projects.
