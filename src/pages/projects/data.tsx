        Mystic Melodies, is a music streaming app that lets you explore the rich
        and diverse traditional sounds of India. It contains a list of regions
        and their traditional songs, which we can listen to through the app
        effortlessly. I noticed that, with the abundance of popular Western
        music, it could be difficult for young people to find their own
        cultures' rich and diverse musical traditions.
